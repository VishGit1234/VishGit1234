# :wave: Hi, I'm Vishal Jayakumar!
I'm currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and am passionate about all things software :computer: and robotics :robot:.
I love learning about the cutting-edge innovations being made in technology (especially in AI and Autonomous Vehicles :car:). Through multiple internships, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to develop software in a variety of environments for many projects. Currently working on turning a Kia Soul into a fully self-driving car as Autonomy Director at <a href="https://www.watonomous.ca/" target="_blank">WATOnomous</a>.
